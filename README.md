# MaxHeap
Repository for my Max Heap Class
## Introduction. 
What is priority queue, how it can be implelented, and why maxheap is a good choice.

## MaxHeap structure
It is basically an array, where elements are positions in such a way in order to aid the process of retrieving the max, and update...

## Implementation
Explain methods
* heapify, why it is needed
* insert, explain comparator and comparable
* heap sort as an alternative to merge sort and quick sort
 



A heap is one of the most efficient implementations of a priority queu. It's time complexity is O(lgN), much better than that of a sorted array which has a complexity of O(N). However, the implementation of a heap is not as commonly seen as a linked list.
In the class I wrote, I implement this
